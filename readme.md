### Note

Personally, I've read the The Art of Assembly book by Randall Hyde from front to back and it was a HUGE help in leaning a lot more than just Assembly code itself. Mr Hyde breaks down the principals of the registers and memory allocations in a nice simple fashion.

Beyond assembly, it is a good read for helping you as a developer make better decisions on coding in any language. Honestly, it was a huge help in my first attempts at creating a simple x86 compiler back in 2007.
