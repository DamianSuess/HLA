Most basic functions you would expect in Notepad.exe
are included in SavageEd.  This short documentation
will cover only items that may differ.

File Menu > New Window
This menu option executes another instance of SavageEd.

Edit > Find/Replace
This opens a find/replace dialog that allows searching and replacing.
There is the added option of "Whole Word".  Further, there is a built
in quick find feature.  Pressing F3 without opening find/replace
dialog will find the next instance of the selected word.


Options > Font
Allows you to select font, point size, effects and color.
Changes will affect the entire document.

Options > Background Color
Allows you to select a color for the background.

Options > Autosave
With this option selected, SavageEd will save the current
document without prompting upon quitting (including quitting
via ESC key).

Options > Stay on Top
This option makes the SavageEd window a "top" window,
meaning it stays on top of other non-top windows.

Options > Read Only
Goes into readonly mode, no changes can be made to documents.
Save and SaveAs still function.

Options > Recent Files 
	>> Open In New Window
		Opens Recent files in new window.
 
	>> Clear On Exit
		Clears the files in the Recent menu on exit.
	 
	>> Open Most Recent
		Opens the most recently accessed document when SavageEd starts.

Options > Save Configuration
	>> Use Private Profile
		This saves the selected configuration options to
		a private initialization file in the current
		directory.

	>> Use Registry
		SavageEd is non-invasive, it will not make any
		additions to your system registry without your
		prior approval via this option.
		If neither of the above 2 options is selected,
		SavageEd will not be able to save your current
		window size/position and selected options.

	>> Uninstall Registry
		If you have previously used the "Use Registry" 
		option and wish to discontinue use of SavageEd
		(why anyone would do such a thing is beyond me),
		use this option to uninstall any changes made to
		your registry.  Once uninstalled, you may manually
		delete any copies of SavageEd on your system.

Log files.
If you wish to use the log feature, it is compatible to the .LOG
feature of Notepad.exe, with an additional extension.

Type .LOG at the top of your document, on the first line, with
nothing else on that line.  From now on, anytime you open the
file with SavageEd, the current system date/time stamp is appended
to the bottom of the document.

Type .LOG< at the top of your document, on the first line, with
nothing else on that line.  From now on, anytime you open the
file with SavageEd, the current system date/time stamp is inserted
at the top of the document, just below the .LOG< .  So the most
recent updates will appear near the top of the document instead of
the bottom.


Printing
A simple printing interface is provided for convenience.  If a line is
too long to fit on a page, it is broken off directly and continued on 
the next line.

Recent Documents
A list of up to 10 recently opened files are stored in File > Recent menu.
The most recent file will be at the top of the menu.
These files are saved from session to session.  To clear the recent menu,
use the menu Option "Clear Recent On Exit"
